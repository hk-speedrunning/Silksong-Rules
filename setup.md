## Installing BepInEx & DebugMod

Please note that you _**must**_ not be using any mods for Speedrun.com submissions; see below for instructions on launching unmodded.

### BepInEx

BepInEx is the modloader we use for Silksong mods.

- Download the x64 .zip file for your OS from [this version](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.3).

### Launching unmodded for runs: Steam

This method adds a separate game to Steam which will always launch with BepInEx.

- Right click `Hollow Knight: Silksong` in the sidebar, press `Properties...`
- Add `--doorstop-enabled false` to the Launch Options bar. This makes your default install unmodded.
- Press `Add a Game > Add non-Steam Game` at the bottom of the sidebar. When prompted, direct it to your existing installation (specifically the Hollow Knight Silksong executable).
  - You can find your game files by right clicking on `Hollow Knight: Silksong` & pressing `Manage > Browse Local Files`.
- Rename your duplicate game - this one will launch modded.

### Launching unmodded for runs: All Platforms

> [!TIP]
> We are currently working on an easier method for other platforms. In the meantime, you can create a second install using whichever method works for your platform
