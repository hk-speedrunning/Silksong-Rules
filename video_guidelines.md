# Hollow Knight: Silksong Video Guidelines

<!-- TODO: check if clause "The top-left corner must be visible to verify whether mods are present." should be added once modlist exists -->

The patch must be clearly visible for at least 1 frame, including all DLC icons if applicable. If the patch is not readable, add a timestamp to a later title screen where patch is visible.

The entire HUD, including the Silk Spool, all tools, all masks, Rosary count & Shell Shard count. No HUD elements may be obscured - this includes if you obtain items that expand the HUD with extra masks or tools (eg. additional masks, lifeblood masks).

Try not to cover too much of the screen with overlay elements - runs may be rejected if Hornet is obscured for significant portions of gameplay. You can mitigate this using a chroma key filter, making Livesplit translucent, making Livesplit smaller, or changing your OBS scene so Livesplit doesn't cover the game at all.
