# Hollow Knight: Silksong Video Guidelines

> NB: assuming that the Silksong coremod will list mods in a similar fashion to HK MAPI.

The patch must be clearly visible for at least 1 frame, including all DLC icons if applicable. The top-left corner must be visible to verify whether mods are present. If the patch is not readable, add a timestamp to a different title screen where it is readable.

> Image of required overlay regions on Title Screen.

> NB: Essence HUD spot equivalent existent? If so add guideline and image here.

The entire HUD, including the Silk Spool, all tools & all masks. No HUD elements may be obscured - this includes if you obtain items that expand the HUD with extra masks or tools (eg. additional masks, lifeblood masks).

> Image of expanded HUD overlay region.

Try not to cover too much of the screen with overlay elements - runs may be rejected if Hornet is obscured for significant portions of gameplay. You can mitigate this using a chroma key filter, making Livesplit translucent, making Livesplit smaller, or changing your OBS scene so Livesplit doesn't cover the game at all.

> Comparison image of Livesplit obscuring gameplay, made smaller to be less obtrusive, with mild transparency and with chroma key.

## Extra examples

> Include examples with legal & illegal modifications active once available.
