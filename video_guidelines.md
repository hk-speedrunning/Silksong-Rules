# Hollow Knight: Silksong Video Guidelines

<!-- TODO: check if clause "The top-left corner must be visible to verify whether mods are present." should be added once modlist exists -->

The patch must be clearly visible for at least 1 frame, including all DLC icons if applicable. If the patch is not readable, add a timestamp to a later title screen where patch is visible.

The entire HUD, including the Silk Spool, all tools, all masks, Rosary count & Shell Shard count. No HUD elements may be obscured - this includes if you obtain items that expand the HUD with extra masks or tools (eg. additional masks, lifeblood masks).

If you are using the autosplitter / load remover, Livesplit must be onscreen at all times with the loadless timer clearly visible.

Try not to cover too much of the screen with overlay elements - runs may be rejected if Hornet is obscured for significant portions of gameplay. You can mitigate this using a chroma key filter, making Livesplit translucent, making Livesplit smaller, or changing your OBS scene so Livesplit doesn't cover the game at all.
