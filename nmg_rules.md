# No Major Glitches rules

If a glitch is not listed here, assume it is banned until it is listed. You can check with a mod in the Discord or create a forum post.

Any accidentally performed major glitch that does not save time may be allowed by verifier's discretion.

## Allowed Glitches

- [Pogo Endlag Cancels](/glossary.md#pogo-endlag-cancel)
- [Beast Boosts](/glossary.md#beast-boost)
- [Bind Dash Refresh](/glossary.md#bind-dash-refresh)
  - NB: this will revisited on at a later time, once we understand the extent of its utility.

## Banned Glitches

- [Triple Jump](/glossary.md#triple-jump)
  - If accidental, a 2s penalty may be applied instead of rejection.
- Scuttlebrace Jump Reset
- [Float Sprint](/glossary.md#float-sprint)
- Volt Vessel Skips
  - NB: this will be revisited at a later time.
