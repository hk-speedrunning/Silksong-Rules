## Terms used

- Input buffering: Pressing some inputs before they are actionable will cause the game to queue the input until the first frame it is actionable. Releasing the button cancels the buffered input.
- Frame perfect / First frame: Generally this means first _physics_ frame, ie 1/50th of a second. It may also refer to the frame of an animation.

## Skips

Skips are individual strategies specific to the room they are used in. This can include specific descriptions of uses of more general tech.

### Bell Beast Phase Skip

...

### Fourth Chorus Skip

Boss sucks? Hit Da Bricks

#### 4CS - Bindless

Fastest, but very precise.

<!-- TODO: insert video -->

#### 4CS - Classic

`Sprintjump - buffered float - dash - bind - buffered float`

#### 4CS - Bind Dash Refresh

...

If using this skip, you may want to gather soul using this hidden room before the boss, unless using it as a backup to Bindless.

...

### Fourth Chorus Quick Kill

Break the explosive nodes above Fourth Chorus - they remain active throughout the fight.

### Beastfly Skip

...

### Sister Splinter Skip

...

## Tech

Tech are strategies that can be used in a variety of places across the run.

### Basic Movement

#### Pogo Endlag Cancel

> Jump -> Attack -> Neutral (no directional input) before hitting the ground.

Removes end lag from the Hunter's Crest pogo, allowing moving early.

#### Sprinthops

> Sprint + jump on same frame. Repeat.

#### Wavedashes

> Sprint -> Jump -> immediately pogo endlag cancel -> Sprint. Repeat

### Beast Boost

> Using Beast Crest, Release Needlestrike while ascending.

You gain a significant amount of height as you lunge forwards. [Video](/media/videos/Beast_Boost.mp4)  <!-- TODO: change to github embed -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you release while descending, you will get a version of the attack that gives you less height. _You will keep getting this worse version until you do a grounded needlestrike or save&quit_.

### Needle Cancels

> Attack -> back -> forward -> cast.

Causes skills like Silk Spear to come out up to 0.2s earlier.

### Dash Cancels

### Bind Dash Refresh

> Bind -> Buffered Dash.

Buffering a dash input allows you to dash even if you have exhausted your midair dash.

### Float Sprint

> [!CAUTION]
> Not allowed in NMG!

> Float -> Cancel float & immediately dash

Allows you to airdash without sprint.

### Triple Jump

> [!CAUTION]
> Not allowed in NMG!

Inputting wings at a specific time after pogoing, dependent on crest, gives 2 wings refreshes instead of one.

### Silkspear Storage Trobbio Skip

> [!CAUTION]
> Not allowed in NMG!

Get hit by a 'hard' hazard on a specific frame of the Silkspear animation. Walk _(todo: required?)_ to the block & stand around x=46.00, then cast again. Block gets hit the wrong way.

<!-- TODO: example + extract silkspear storage to tech -->

## Documentation

### The Mist

The Mist is intended to be navigated by playing Needolin to butterflies, which show the correct exit to proceed through. We can use various aspects of the Mist's progression to our advantage; see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGYxE_mDfZ_Qtbs6cvcTZggTFPYTBJ9Rijno0VZkNdA/view) for more information.
