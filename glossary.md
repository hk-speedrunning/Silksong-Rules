## Terms used

- Input buffering: Pressing some inputs before they are actionable will cause the game to queue the input until the first frame it is actionable. Releasing the button cancels the buffered input.
- Frame perfect / First frame: Generally this means first _physics_ frame, ie 1/50th of a second.

## Skips

Skips are individual strategies specific to the room they are used in. This can include specific descriptions of uses of more general tech.

### Fourth Chorus Skip - Bind Dash Refresh

> [!WARNING] Not currently allowed in NMG!

## Tech

Tech are strategies that can be used in a variety of places across the run.

### Beast Boost

> Using Beast Crest, Release Great Slash.

You gain a little more height. Can be used as an extra boost.

> [!IMPORTANT] Patch differences!
> On Release Patch, this tech is bugged - if you release while descending, you will not get the height, and will enter a state where you must great slash while _grounded_ before being able to get the height again.

### Pogo Endlag Cancel

> Jump -> Attack -> Neutral before hitting the ground.

Removes end lag from the Hunter's Crest pogo, allowing moving early.

### Needle Cancels

> Attack -> back -> forward -> cast.

Causes skills like Silk Spear to come out up to 0.2s earlier.

### Bind Dash Refresh

> [!WARNING] Not currently allowed in NMG!
> This item is subject to an upcoming vote - see the Discord for more details.

> Dash -> Buffered Bind.

Refreshes midair dash _only_ if the input is buffered.
