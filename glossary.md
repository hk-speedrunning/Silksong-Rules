## Terms used

- Input buffering: Pressing some inputs before they are actionable will cause the game to queue the input until the first frame it is actionable. Releasing the button cancels the buffered input.
- Frame perfect / First frame: Generally this means first _physics_ frame, ie 1/50th of a second. It may also refer to the frame of an animation.

## Skips

Skips are individual strategies specific to the room they are used in. This can include specific descriptions of uses of more general tech.

### Bell Beast Phase Skip

...

### Fourth Chorus Skip

Boss sucks? Hit Da Bricks.

If using a version that requires Binding, note there is a hidden room filled with silk before the fight.

#### 4CS - Bindless

Fastest, but very precise.

<!-- TODO: insert video -->

#### 4CS - Classic

`Sprintjump -> buffered float -> dash -> bind -> buffered float`

#### 4CS - Bind Dash Refresh

`Sprintjump -> `

### Fourth Chorus Quick Kill

Break the explosive nodes above Fourth Chorus - they remain active throughout the fight.

### Fourth Chorus Skip Skip

> [!WARNING]
> Not currently allowed in NMG; this item is subject to an upcoming vote.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Frame rate dependant! Uncap for best results.

> Hand in Flexile Spines quest -> Press pause immediately after finishing the dialogue

Avoids the hardsave when obtaining Drifter's Cloak, allowing you to save&quit to a bench before Fourth Chorus while keeping Drifter's Cloak.

### Beastfly Skip

...

### Sister Splinter Skip

...

### Trobbio Skip - Silkspear Storage

> [!CAUTION]
> Not allowed in NMG!

Get hit by a 'hard' hazard on a specific frame of the Silkspear animation. Walk _(todo: required?)_ to the block & stand around x=46.00, then cast again. Block gets hit the wrong way.

### Trobbio Skip - Rune Rage

> [!WARNING]
> Not currently allowed in NMG; this item is up for reconsideration.

Cast Rune Rage within a narrow window, such that there is line of sight between the block and ceiling. The hitboxes spawn on the other side of the block, pushing it towards you.

## Tech

Tech are strategies that can be used in a variety of places across the run.

### Basic Movement

#### Pogo Endlag Cancel

> Jump -> Attack -> Neutral (no directional input) before hitting the ground.

Removes end lag from the Hunter's Crest pogo, allowing moving early.

#### Sprinthops

> Sprint + jump on same frame. Repeat.

#### Wavedashes

> Sprint -> Jump -> immediately pogo endlag cancel -> Sprint. Repeat

### Beast Boost

> Using Beast Crest, Release Needlestrike while ascending.

You gain a significant amount of height as you lunge forwards. [Video](/media/videos/Beast_Boost.mp4)  <!-- TODO: change to github embed -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you release while descending, you will get a version of the attack that gives you less height. _You will keep getting this worse version until you do a grounded needlestrike or save&quit_.

### Needle Cancels

> Attack -> back -> forward -> cast.

Causes skills like Silk Spear to come out up to 0.2s earlier.

### Dash Cancels

### Bind Dash Refresh

> Bind -> Buffered Dash.

Buffering a dash input allows you to dash even if you have exhausted your midair dash.

### Voltvessel Drill Pogos

> Throw Voltvessels > Use Delver's Drill above them

Delver's Drill allows you to pogo off your own Voltvessels. You can upslash the Voltvessel before it detonates to reposition it favourably.

### Float Sprint

> [!CAUTION]
> Not allowed in NMG!

> Float -> Cancel float & immediately dash

Allows you to airdash without sprint.

### Triple Jump

> [!CAUTION]
> Not allowed in NMG!

Inputting wings at a specific time after pogoing, dependent on crest, gives 2 wings refreshes instead of one.

### Voltvessel Wall Breaks

> [!WARNING]
> Not currently allowed in NMG; this is due for reconsideration.

The damage from Voltvessels can hit the backside of one-way breakable walls.

### The Mist

The Mist is intended to be navigated by playing Needolin to butterflies, which show the correct exit to proceed through. We can use various aspects of the Mist's progression to our advantage; see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGYxE_mDfZ_Qtbs6cvcTZggTFPYTBJ9Rijno0VZkNdA/view) for more information.
